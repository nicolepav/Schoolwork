*Summary of Course Content*

- Combinational and Sequential Digital Design Boolean algebra, gates. - Commonly used MSI circuits such as multiplexers and decoders. Simple arithmetic circuits. Latches and flip-flops. Finite state machine design. Use of simple digital design simulation software to aid in hierarchical system development.
- Interrupts and Interconnection hardware Hardware interrupts. Synchronous and asynchronous buses. Bus arbitration.
- Memory Types of memory. Decoding of system-level to chip-level addresses. Caches and the memory hierarchy.
- Hardware for Support of Operating Systems Hardware support to optimize resource usage, and to implement the abstraction of a separate machine for each user. Design and use of memory-management hardware, either within-CPU or via separate MMU, to support efficient and convenient OS memory allocation.
