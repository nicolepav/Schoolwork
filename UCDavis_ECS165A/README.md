**About this project:**
Completed during winter quarter 2021, this project was to create a simplified HTAP (Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing) database, broken into three milestones and written in Python.

M1: Data model, bufferpool management, query interface
M2: Durability and bufferpool extension, contention-free merge, indexing
M3: Multi-statement transactions, concurrency control with 2 phase locking

You can find details on the implementation of each milestone on their respective slides: [Milestone 1,](https://github.com/nicolepav/ECS165A/blob/main/Milestone%20One.pptx) [Milestone 2](https://github.com/nicolepav/ECS165A/blob/main/Milestone%20Two.pptx), [Milestone 3](https://github.com/nicolepav/ECS165A/blob/main/Milestone%20Three.pptx).
